# BMGF-Caltech_Imaris-Analysis
This repository contains a script for extracting surface volume data from spreadsheets generated by Imaris surface statistics exports.
The script was written to extract data from the Dec. 2021 BMGF experiments testing AAV serotypes and concentrations for follicle infection
and assumes a particular input format and filename.
The repository also contains all of the input, output, and testing csv and xls files, since I didn't have time to organize this better.
